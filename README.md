# Deus Ex: Human Revolution (1.0) for Launchy (2.0)
_by Jason Maggiacomo (Nextrix)_

Replicating a launchy terminal using the same style as the login window on computers in the video game Deus Ex: Human Revolution. Login button now works at a config button.

I don't work for Edios Interactive, but most of the credit should go to team there for building an amazing game. I'm just a fan and a web designer trying to customize my experience of the Deus Ex universe outside of the game.

I hope you enjoy using this skin as much as I did making it!

## Instructions

To install just unzip the folder and place it in your launchy skins folder. (Program Files\Launchy\skins)
