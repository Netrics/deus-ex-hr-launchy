Deus Ex: Human Revolution (1.0) for Launchy (2.0)
by Jason Maggiacomo (Nextrix)  |  http://nextrix.deviantart.com

Replicating a launchy terminal using the same style 
as the login window on computers in the video game Deus Ex: 
Human Revolution. Login button now works at a config button.

I don't work for Edios Interactive, but most of the credit should go to 
team there for building an amazing game. I'm just a fan and a 
web designer trying to customize my experience of the Deus Ex universe 
outside of the game.

I hope you enjoy using this skin as much as I did making it!
